## About
A multipaged E-commerce website where we can view versatile clothing and accessories, buy them by adding to cart and billing them.



## Getting Started
E-Commerce is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. More and more business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for performing commercial transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of shopping on the web is becoming common place. The objective of this project is to develop a general- purpose e-commerce store where products like clothes can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet. However, for implementation purposes, this paper will deal with online shopping for clothes. An online store is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more information will be needed to complete the transaction. Usually, the customer will be asked to fill or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and payment information such as credit card number.As soon as the details entered, it mentions Happy shopping board and lets us back to homepage of the Website.


## Deployment

This project is deployed into github by creating a new repository and following the below commands in the Vs code terminal.

```bash
 git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/ManotejPatlolla/Example.git

```
